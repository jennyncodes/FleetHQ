## 🚀 Getting Started
 
### Prerequisites
 
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
 
- **Node.js** (v18.0.0 or higher)
  ```bash
  node --version
  ```
  Download: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
 
- **npm** (v9.0.0 or higher, comes with Node.js)
  ```bash
  npm --version
  ```
 
- **Python** (v3.9 or higher)
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
  Download: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
 
- **Postgres** (local or GCP Compute Engine VM)
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (cloud)
 
- **Git**
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
  Download: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
 
### Installation
 
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fleethq.git
   cd fleethq
   ```
 
2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd fleet-hq/frontend
   npm install
   ```
 
3. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd fleethq
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # Mac / Linux
   # venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
 

 
## 🎮 Running the Application
 
You need **two terminal windows** — one for the backend, one for the frontend.
 
**Terminal 1 — Start Flask Backend**
```bash
cd fleethq/backend
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac / Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
 
python main.py
```
✅ Backend will run on: `http://localhost:8080`
 
**Terminal 2 — Start React Frontend**
```bash
cd fleet-hq/frontend
npm run dev
```
✅ Frontend will run on: `http://localhost:3000`
 
Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. Vite automatically proxies all `/api/*` requests to Flask on port 8080 — no extra configuration needed.
 
### Production Build
 
**Build Frontend (outputs into Flask's static folder):**
```bash
cd fleet-hq/frontend
npm run build
```
 
**Deploy to GCP App Engine:**
```bash
cd fleethq
gcloud app deploy
gcloud app browse
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema
 
Based on the Phase 2 EER Diagram — 13 tables implementing the full relational model:
 
| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `FOOD_TRUCK` | Fleet vehicles with status and cuisine type |
| `LOCATION` | Operating spots with GPS coordinates and zone type |
| `SCHEDULE` | Truck-location time assignments (Scheduled_At relationship) |
| `MENU` | One menu per truck |
| `DISH` | Individual menu items with pricing and cost |
| `INGREDIENT` | Ingredient master list |
| `DISH_INGREDIENT` | Many-to-many: dishes ↔ ingredients |
| `INVENTORY` | Per-truck ingredient stock levels with min thresholds |
| `CUSTOMER` | Customer profiles with loyalty tiers (soft delete) |
| `ORDER_` | Customer orders with full lifecycle tracking |
| `ORDER_ITEM` | Weak entity — line items per order |
| `EMPLOYEE` | Staff with IS-A → DRIVER / MANAGER subtypes |
| `EVENT` | Events and festivals |
| `EVENT_BOOKING` | Many-to-many: events ↔ trucks |
